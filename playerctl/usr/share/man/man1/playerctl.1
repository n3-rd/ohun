.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls MPRIS-enabled media players.
In addition to offering play, pause and stop control,
.Nm
also offers previous and next track support,
the ability to seek backwards and forwards in a track,
and volume control.
.Nm
also supports displaying metadata
.Pq e.g., artist, title, album
for the current track,
and showing the status of the player.

any player that implements the MPRIS interface specification
can be controlled using

.Ss Format Strings
The output of the
.Cm position ,
.Cm metadata ,
.Cm status
and
.Cm volume
commands can be controlled using a format string.
Variables set by these commands can be included in the format string
by enclosing them in curly braces:
.Ql Brq Brq Va var .
These will then be expanded on output.
.Pp
Each command has access to the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va playerName
The name of the current player.
.It Va position
The time position of the current track,
in microseconds.
.It Va status
The status of the current player.
.It Va volume
The player's volume scaled from 0.0
.Pq 0%
to 1.0
.Pq 100% .
.El
.Pp
Each property listed in the
.Cm metadata
command are also set as variables.
It is recommended to check this list for each player,
as different players may not set the same properties.
See the

for a list of all properties in the MPRIS specification.
The most common properties are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va album , xesam:album
