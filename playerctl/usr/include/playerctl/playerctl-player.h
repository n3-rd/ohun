/**
 * SECTION: playerctl-player
 * @short_description: A class to control a media player.
 *
 * The #PlayerctlPlayer represents a proxy connection to a media player through
 * an IPC interface that is capable of performing commands and executing
 * queries on the player for properties and metadata.
 *
 * If you know the name of your player and that it is running, you can use
 * playerctl_player_new() giving the player name to connect to it. The player
 * names given are the same as you can get with the binary `playerctl
 * --list-all` command. Using this function will get you the first instance of
 *  the player it can find, or the exact instance if you pass the instance as
 *  the player name.
 *
 * If you would like to connect to a player dynamically, you can list players
 * to be controlled with playerctl_list_players() or use the
 * #PlayerctlPlayerManager class and read the list of player name containers in
 * the #PlayerctlPlayerManager:player-names property or listen to the
 * #PlayerctlPlayerManager::name-appeared event. If you have a
 * #PlayerctlPlayerName, you can use the playerctl_player_new_from_name()
 * function to create a #PlayerctlPlayer from this name.
 *
 * Once you have a player, you can give it commands to play, pause, stop, open
 * a file, etc with the provided functions listed below. You can also query for
 * properties such as the playback status, position, and shuffle status. Each
 * of these has an event that will be emitted when these properties change
 * during a main loop.
 *
 * For examples on how to use the #PlayerctlPlayer, see the `examples`
 * directory in the git repository.
