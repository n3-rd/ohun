 * Contains connection information that fully qualifies a potential connection

 * list the names that are available to control from the
 * playerctl_list_players() function or use the
 * #PlayerctlPlayerManager:player-names property from a
 * #PlayerctlPlayerManager.
 *
 * Once you have gotten a player name like this, you can check the type of
 * player with the "name" property to see if you are interested in connecting
 * to it. If you are, you can pass it directly to the
 * playerctl_player_new_from_name() function to get a #PlayerctlPlayer that is
 * connected to this name and ready to command and query.
