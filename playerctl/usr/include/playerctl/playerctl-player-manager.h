/**
 * SECTION: playerctl-player-manager
 * @short_description: A class to watch for players appearing and vanishing.
 *
 * The #PlayerctlPlayerManager is a class to watch for players appearing and
 * vanishing. When a player opens and is available to control by `playerctl`,
 * the #PlayerctlPlayerManager::name-appeared event will be emitted on the
 * manager during the main loop. You can inspect this #PlayerctlPlayerName to
 * see if you want to manage it. If you do, create a #PlayerctlPlayer from it
 * with the playerctl_player_new_from_name() function. The manager is also
 * capable of keeping an up-to-date list of players you want it to manage in
 * the #PlayerctlPlayerManager:players list. These players are connected and
 * should be able to be controlled. Managing players is optional, and you can
 * do so manually if you like.
 *
 * When the player disconnects, the #PlayerctlPlayerManager::name-vanished
 * event will be emitted. If the player is managed and is going to be removed
 * from the list, the #PlayerctlPlayerManager::player-vanished event will also
 * be emitted. After this event, the player will be cleaned up and removed from
 * the manager.
 *
 * The manager has other features such as being able to keep the players in a
 * sorted order and moving a player to the top of the list. The
 * #PlayerctlPlayerManager:player-names will always be in the order that they
 * were known to appear after the manager was created.
 *
 * For examples on how to use the manager, see the `examples` folder in the git
 * repository.
